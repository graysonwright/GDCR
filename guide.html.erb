  <h2>Help the global coordinators</h2>
  <p>We are looking for volunteers to help us coordinate the global event. For example, I am sure you will all agree <a href="http://gdcr.coderetreat.org">gdcr.coderetreat.org</a> could use some work. We are looking for volunteers to help with:
  <ul>
    <li>designing and managing the websites</li>
    <li>assisting with training new hosts and facilitators</li>
    <li>creating promotional materials and templates for use by local event hosts</li>
    <li>helping with general event record-keeping and tracking</li>
  </ul>
  </p><p>If you would like to take-it-up-a-notch by helping with any of the above, or if you know someone who might be able to help, please <a href="mailto:gdcr@coderetreat.org">email us</a>! Together, we can make this event more amazing!</p>
